Room booking website developed with php and jquery (ajax). 

The administrator can add any room content (text, img) and publish it to the home page so the average user can look at the several rooms available and add comments and quotations of his experiences.

The sql database is available inside the folder "db". You can import it from the phpmyadmin IHM or the sql terminal.

Feel free to add any comments on the website or join the project.
